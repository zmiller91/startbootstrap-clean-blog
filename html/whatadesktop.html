                    <p>This website is the first website I completed. &nbsp;It was my first exposure into user management, APIs, and AngularJS. &nbsp;As such, there are areas where I&rsquo;m clearly deficient or didn&rsquo;t spend much time; in my opinion this is the cost of learning a new language and framework. &nbsp;I think this project is cool and simple, it&rsquo;s probably something I&rsquo;ll revisit at a later date.</p>
                    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
                    <p>WhataDesktop is my solution to easily finding new desktop wallpapers. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always hated the stock wallpapers and I never enjoyed actively finding new ones. &nbsp;Most the sites I went to were difficult to use or required too much user input &nbsp;-- I&rsquo;m not very creative I can only think of so many search words. &nbsp;Instead, I decided to build a website that brought wallpapers to me. </p>
                    <p>WhataDesktop is is an AngularJS application that displays images collected by a python script. &nbsp;The application is displayed in such a way that I can preview how a wallpaper will appear on my computer before I download it. &nbsp;I can use specific hotkeys to easily navigate through the image queue, remove or save images, and download images. &nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>Software</h2>
                    <p>There are two components to this website: a front end application that uses a REST API and a python script that uses Reddit to source images. &nbsp;Once a day (schedule via cron) my python script will execute and collect any imgur links on the front page of chosen subreddits (e.g. wallpapers), it will store those links in a database with associated metadata. &nbsp;These images are queried from the client to create image &lsquo;queues.&rsquo;</p>
                    <h3>Image Collection</h3>
                    <p>There is nothing special here. &nbsp;This is my least favorite part about this application and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to rework. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like most python scripts I write, they exist solely to accomplish one task. As such, the python code tends to be, uh, unprofessional. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a python developer and I don&rsquo;t know python coding standards -- this is all blatantly obvious. </p>
                    <p>The python script I use parses a reddit json url and searches for imgur links. &nbsp;When an imgur link is found it&rsquo;s metadata is retrieved, parsed, and stored in a database. The database contains the asset URL, imgur identifier, width, height, and a unique hash that identifies the image and it&rsquo;s dimensions. &nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>API</h3>
                    <p>My API queries the database for various images and returns a list of images back to the client. &nbsp;Each image contains specific metadata like aspect ratio, width, and size; it also contains a set of URLs that point to different image resolutions. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Show JSON response</p>
                    <p>There are predefined filters that are used to sort images according to popularity and newness; the default filter is to randomize the list of images. An images popularity is determined by the number of people that liked or disliked an image; the more an image gets saved the more it gains in popularity. A more traditional filter also exists for targeting specific width or height requirements and aspect ratios. </p>
                    <h3>AngularJS Application</h3>
                    <p>This website was my first exposure to angular JS, so I spent most of my time on this part of the application. It uses the concept of an &lsquo;image queue&rsquo; that is traversed to display images that auto resize to fit your screen. &nbsp;It also uses ngroute to separate logical areas of the application (e.g. queue/random, saved/, and deleted/), this was also new to me and I&rsquo;m glad I did it because it has all the benefits of a single page application without the nasty single URL.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion the most interesting part of the application is the image queue. &nbsp;It is a data structure that acts a carousel - circular queue - that can be traversed forward and backward. &nbsp;It also has the ability to add, remove, and &lsquo;seek to&rsquo; images in the queue. &nbsp;Essentially, an image queue is a dynamic array backed by a dictionary, this gives us: <br /><br /></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>O(n) delete and seek</li>
                    <li>O(1) contains, get, add, and update </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After writing these, I realized I can get constant delete and seek by changing the dynamic array to a linked list and keeping a &nbsp;reference to an images node in the dictionary. &nbsp;Oh well, something to do at a later date. </p>
