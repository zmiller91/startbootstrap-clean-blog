I think Raspberry Pis are incredible pieces of technology and I enjoy exploring the relationship between software and hardware.  As such, I spend most of my time tinkering with circuits and writing useless pieces of software.

I'm not a UX designer, electrical engineer, or mechanical engineer; if you're either of these and want to collaborate don't hesitate to contact me.  I have some projects that are too large for one person, and I'd be awesome if others wanted to contribute.
