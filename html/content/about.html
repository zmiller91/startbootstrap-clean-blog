<p>By day, I'm a back end software engineer that focuses on data collection and business reporting. By night, I'm a lazy dude that will go through great lenghts to not leave his comfortable office chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not pretend to be a designer, electrical engineer, or mechanical engineer -- as may already be apparent. &nbsp;I do, however, think Raspberry Pis are incredibly powerful tools that can be used to automate much of my life. &nbsp;As such, I spend most of my free times tinkering with circuits and writing useless pieces of software.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, would like to collaborate on a project, or would like me to do some work then please feel free to reach out! I'm always looking for cool new projects or new ways of getting paid.</p>
